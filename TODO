In no particular order:
=======================
- Gapless AAC playback using iTunSMPB atoms
- Rename files based on tags
- Guess tags based on filenames
- Plugin architecture
- Fix RBSplitView "can't find ibplugin" bug
- Add groups: when added, a group for the files is automatically created based on the root of the add. The streams reference it by id and a stream_group consists of at least ID, name, url, url_bookmark
- We can use an RBSplitView left of the library that can be shown/hidden left of the library table to filter the library for groups
- We can move and copy streams between groups
- We can add groups manually
- Switch to 10.5's IB non-programmatic toolbars
