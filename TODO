In no particular order:
=======================
- Gapless AAC playback using iTunSMPB atoms
- Rename files based on tags
- Guess tags based on filenames (maybe via regex like Media Rage)
- Plugin architecture
- Add groups: when added, a group for the files is automatically created based on their shared root in the file system. The streams reference it by id and a stream_group consists of at least and ID, it's name, a url and a url_bookmark. 
- Groups are a persistent way to organize files without using playlists. The main difference is that they have a relationship with a root folder in the file system. We could simply implement this via or similarily to smart playlists that filter streams by file system location. 
- Allow to add groups manually
- We can use an RBSplitView for the borwser that can be shown/hidden left of the library table to filter the library for groups
- Enable double-clicking to edit Smart Playlists
- Fix empty values for play count, etc OR allow specifying empty values for Smart Playlists
- Re-design toolbar icons
- Make sure the Browser is made visible when "Show Browser" is chosen from the menu: if the main window fills the screen you may never realize it's there and supect a bug or missing feature as happened to me. We achieve this by shrinking the window horizontally by the width of the browser if the main window is within a threshhold of maybe 32 px of the screen width.
- Open browser and select new entry when adding (smart) playlists
- Allow scanning the library/selection for missing files. 
- Offer to find missing files (semi-)automatically (via Spotlight, exact file name, metadata and file type match, etc.)
- show/hide browser from toolbar.
