In no particular order:
=======================
- Gapless AAC playback using iTunSMPB atoms
- Rename files based on tags
- Guess tags based on filenames (maybe via regex like Media Rage)
- Plugin architecture
- Add groups: when added, a group for the files is automatically created based on their shared root in the file system. The streams reference it by id and a stream_group consists of at least and ID, it's name, a url and a url_bookmark. 
- Groups are a persistent way to organize files without using playlists. The main difference is that they have a relationship with a root folder in the file system, which helps in the rediscovery of missing files. We could simply implement this via or similarly to smart playlists that filter streams by file system location. 
- Allow to add these groups manually
- Allow to filter the library for groups
- We can use an RBSplitView for the browser so it can be shown/hidden left of the library table (see Apple’s “SourceView” sample code)
- Enable double-clicking to edit Smart Playlists
- Fix empty values for play count, etc OR allow specifying empty values for Smart Playlists
- Make sure the Browser is made visible when "Show Browser" is chosen from the menu: if the main window fills the screen you may never realize it's there and suspect a bug or missing feature as happened to me. We achieve this by shrinking the window horizontally by the width of the browser if the main window is within a threshold of maybe 32 px of the screen width.
- Open browser and select new entry when adding (smart) playlists
- Allow scanning the library/selection for missing files. 
- Offer to rediscover missing files (semi-)automatically (via Spotlight, exact file name, metadata and file type match, etc.)
- Fix crash when playing flac files whose metadata is being edited externally.
- Optionally save playlist after a song has been played. 
- Fix bug: track that starts playing while Play is adding files to the library will loop until adding is done.
- Adding B.A.D. collection of FLAC files won’t finish by itself. We can still quit Play, though. Adding the flac files from a Spotlight search instead of adding the root folder will finish correctly.
- For some files the Date metadate does not refresh after rescanning.
- Scroll to newly added play queue items.
